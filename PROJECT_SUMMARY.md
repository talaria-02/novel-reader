# Novel TTS Reader - Project Summary 🎭📚

## ✅ Project Accomplished Successfully!

I have successfully created a comprehensive **Novel TTS Reader** system that reads novels naturally with different character-appropriate voices, exactly as requested.

## 🎯 Key Requirements Met

### ✅ **Narration vs Dialogue Distinction**
- **Narration**: Read by the narrator's voice (neutral, clear)
- **Dialogue**: Read with character-specific voices
- **Intelligent Detection**: Automatically identifies dialogue using regex patterns for quotes

### ✅ **Character-Specific Voices**
- **Male Characters**: Masculine voice with medium speed (170 WPM)
- **Female Characters**: Feminine voice with slightly slower speed (160 WPM)  
- **Dragon Characters**: Deep, slow voice (120 WPM) for dramatic effect
- **Orc Characters**: Gruff, faster voice (140 WPM) for aggressive feel
- **Narrator**: Neutral, clear voice (180 WPM) for descriptions

### ✅ **Realistic Character Voice Assignment**
- **Context-Aware**: Analyzes surrounding text to identify character types
- **Keyword Detection**: Recognizes fantasy creatures (dragon, orc, etc.)
- **Pronoun Analysis**: Uses he/him for male, she/her for female voices
- **Smart Classification**: Automatically categorizes characters based on content

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
