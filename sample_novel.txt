The ancient castle stood silently against the moonlit sky, its towers reaching toward the stars like gnarled fingers. Within its walls, a most unusual meeting was about to take place.

"Are you certain this is wise?" asked Princess Luna, her voice trembling with uncertainty. She clutched her silk dress nervously as she approached the great hall.

The old wizard Merlin stroked his long white beard thoughtfully. "Child, wisdom often requires us to face our greatest fears," he said gently. "The dragon has requested this audience for a reason."

From the shadows of the hall, a massive form stirred. The ancient dragon Flameheart emerged, his scales glinting like molten gold in the torchlight. "Fear not, young princess," the dragon rumbled, his voice like distant thunder. "I have not summoned you here to cause harm."

Princess Luna stepped forward bravely, though her heart pounded in her chest. "Then why have you called for me, great one?" she whispered.

Before the dragon could answer, heavy footsteps echoed through the corridor. An orc warrior named Grothak burst through the doors, his axe gleaming wickedly. "The princess is under my protection now!" he snarled, his voice harsh and guttural. "Dragon or not, you will not harm her!"

The dragon's eyes flashed with amusement rather than anger. "Peace, noble orc," Flameheart said with what might have been a chuckle. "I seek only to warn the princess of the approaching darkness."

Merlin nodded gravely. The ancient prophecy was beginning to unfold, and all their fates were now intertwined. The wind howled through the castle's ancient stones as if the very walls knew that great changes were coming.

"What darkness do you speak of?" Luna asked, finding courage in her voice.

"An army marches from the north," the dragon explained, his great head lowering to meet her gaze. "Led by the Shadow King himself. Only by working together can we hope to stop him."

Grothak grunted his approval. "Then we fight as one," the orc declared fiercely. "Dragon, wizard, princess, and warrior united against the coming storm!"

The moon disappeared behind the clouds as the unlikely alliance was formed, and the first chapter of their epic adventure began.
